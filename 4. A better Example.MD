### Code, finally:

### Imports

### Extending Panel.Button
ButtonBox: The base button class for buttons in the panel (incorporates the -minimum-hpadding and -natural-hpadding attributes in the panel-button style class - so whatever you insert into the ButtonBox should get padded uniformly with all the other buttons in the panel.
Button: Inherits from ButtonBox - adds a menu. So this is an object for use in the panel that will have a menu and some sort of display item (e.g. an icon), which you are responsible for defining and adding. The date menu is an example of this (its display item is a St.Label with the current date/time).
SystemStatusButton: This is just a Button with an icon. Feed it in an icon name (one of the stock icon names) and it'll display it. Just about every icon you have in your status area is one of these (accessibility indicator, network indicator, ...).
### PopupMenuItems

PopupBaseMenuItem: Base class for popup menu items - an empty popup menu item. Has an 'activate' signal that gets fired when the item is activated. Use .addActor to add visual elements to it (like a St.Label). All the other Popup*MenuItem classes inherit from this (and respond to the 'activate' signal).
PopupMenuItem: A PopupBaseMenuItem that displays text (in a St.Label).
PopupSeparatorMenuItem: A PopupBaseMenuItem that is a separator.
PopupAlternatingMenuItem: A PopupBaseMenuItem that has two texts - one that shows by default, and one that appears upon pressing Clutter.ModifierType.MOD1_MASK (Alt for me). The alternating 'Suspend...'/'Power off' menu item in the user menu is one of these.
PopupSliderMenuItem: A PopupBaseMenuItem that is a slider widget. Its value is between 0 and 1 and the item doesn't include a label showing the slider's current value, so that's your job. Example: the volume slider. Use the 'value-changed' signal to detect when the user moves the slider (gets fired with the current value as an argument), and/or the 'drag-end' signal to detect when the user has finished dragging the slider. For example, you could have a label displaying the current value of the slider that gets updated on 'value-changed', and then an action that gets taken when 'drag-end' occurs.
Switch: An on-off toggle switch (not a PopupBaseMenuItem; see PopupSwitchMenuItem for that).
PopupSwitchMenuItem: A PopupBaseMenuItem containing a label/text and a Switch to the right. Example: Wifi/wired connection on/off switch in the network menu. Use the 'toggled' signal to determine when the user toggles it.
PopupImageMenuItem: A PopupBaseMenuItem containing a label/text and an icon to the right. Example: in the network menu, available wifi networks have the network name and an icon indicating connection strength.
PopupSubMenuMenuItem: A PopupBaseMenuItem defining a collapsible submenu - click on it to expand/open the submenu and reveal the items inside. Is really just a PopupBaseMenuItem with a label and a PopupSubMenu. Use myItem.menu.addMenuItem to add to its menu.
PopupComboBoxMenuItem: A PopupBaseMenuItem that is a combo box. Example: the chat status combo box (available/offline) in the user menu. Use myItem.addMenuItem(item) to add a choice to the combo box, and myItem.setActiveItem to set the active item. When a selection is changed, it emits signal active-item-changed with the (0-based) index of the activated item.
Menus:

PopupMenuBase: The base class for a popup menu (e.g. the menu that appears when you click most of the items in the status area). You don't use this directly (unless you are extending it); use any of its child classes and use menu.addMenuItem to add a popup menu item/submenu to it.
PopupMenu: Extends PopupMenuBase to provide a popup menu. This is the main popup menu class (the one that gets used for all the PanelMenu.Buttons).
PopupSubMenu: A popup submenu - designed to be nested within a PopupMenu, has a scrollbar in case the content is too long. If you want to add it to a PopupMenu as a collapsible menu section, use PopupSubMenuMenuItem.
PopupMenuSection: This acts like a PopupSubMenu, but to the user just looks like a normal PopupMenu. It can be useful to add multiple PopupMenuSections to a single PopupMenu to 'group' items together code-wise (and to the user it looks like a flat popup menu).
PopupComboMenu: Extends PopupMenuBase: this is the menu that drops down from a combo box. If you want a combo box, use PopupComboBoxMenuItem.
RemoteMenu (GNOME 3.4 only): "A PopupMenu that tracks a GMenuModel and shows its actions (exposed by GApplication/GActionGroup). This adds application-specific menu items to a menu (for example in Epiphany the titlebar menu shows 'New Window', 'Bookmarks', etc).
Misc:

PopupMenuManager: "Basic implementation of a menu manager. Call addMenu to add menus". I think you use this if you want to manage multiple menus (???). For example, all the status area menus and the date menu appear to have the same manager (Main.panel._menus). It also looks like it handles the menus grabbing focus, responding to key events, etc.
