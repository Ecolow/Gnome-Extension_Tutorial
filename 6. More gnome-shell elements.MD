# More gnome-shell elements
Unfortunately, I don't have the patience to go through all these files and describe in details what they do how.
If you want something a bit more complete, but outdated, you can go to MathematicalCoffee's excelent blog post on the subject. 
(Thanks by the way).
## UI files in /usr/share/gnome-shell/js/ui (imports.ui)
