# A quick introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript (sometimes abbreviated JS), is a prototype-based scripting language. It is dynamic, weakly typed, has first-class functions and supports object-oriented. 

Gnome-shell is written in JavaScript because it allows for quick prototyping and development cycles. The difference between javascript and other dynamic languages (python, ruby, php, etc...) is that javascript doesn't depend on a specific platform. Gnome-shell can than run it with its own platform (Gjs).

### Variable declaration 
A constant is a variable that cannot be reassign :

	const x = 0;
	
If you need to reassign, like in a for loop for example.

	var y =1 ; 
 	let z= 2; 
var is without a scope, you can use it anywhere in your code.
let has a single block scope : like in a for loop for example.

Variables can also be declared by using matching arrays or objects :

	let [ a, b, c ] = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
	let { a, b } = { a: "apple", b: "banana" };

### If/else/elseif
	if (x>0) { 
		print(“Positive number”)  ; 
	} else if (x<0) {
		print(“Not a positive number”); 
	} else { 
		print(“Not a number”); 
	};

### For loops:
	for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		print(i)
	};.
	// 0, 1, 2, 3 ... 9

Looping over arrays using for...of is much more convenient.

	let fruits = [ "apple", "orange", "banana" ];

	for (let fruit of fruits) {
    		print(fruit);
	} 
	// apple, orange, banana
	
### Functions
	function Foo(arg1, arg2) {do something}
Function parameters can accept default values; 

	function add(x, y = 0) {
    		return x + y;
	}

### Imports :
You import objects from the imports object.

	const Gio = imports.gi.Gio;
	const Panel = imports.ui.Panel;

If you want to include your own files, you have to add the current directory to the search path.

	imports.searchPath.unshift(".");
	const Awesome = imports.awesome; // import awesome.js from current directory

If your file is under a sub-directory, you can use . instead of / for the separator.

	const Awesome = imports.lib.awesome; // import lib/awesome.js

### Class Inheritance
I like the simplicity and readability of the Lang.Class function :

	const Lang = imports.lang

	const New_Class = new Lang.Class({
    		Name: 'new class',
    		Extends: Old_class,
 
        		_init: function() {do something};
	});
	
### Using "this" in closures
"this" has a restricted scope, relative to how the closure is invoked, not to the value of this where the closure is created. It needs to be passed to the function or callback at invocation time. To do this, use the Lang.bind() helper function :

	const Lang = imports.lang;
	
	let closure = Lang.bind( this, this._Foo )
	
### Extending pre-existing Functions 
Rather than disabeling parts of the gnome-shell and re-writing the whole code to fit your needs, you can simply modify it directly.

Say we have the following class Foo :

	const Lang = imports.gi.lang
 
	const Foo = new Lang.Class({
    	Name: 'Foo',

    		_init : function() {
        		this.variable  = 2
			this._Bar()
		},
	
		_Bar : function (metaWindow) {
        		return this.variable ;
    		}
	})
If we want to modify the _Bar function to always return 1, we edit its "prototype". Simply name the function, object or variable that you want to modify in the brackets (quoted) and replace it's code :

	Foo.prototype['_Bar'] = function() { return 1; }

Another way to extend functionality is to inject code, with these functions:

	function injectToFunction(parent, name, func)
	{
	        let origin = parent[name];
	        parent[name] = function()
	        {
	                let ret;
	                ret = origin.apply(this, arguments);
	                if (ret === undefined)
	                        ret = func.apply(this, arguments);
	                return ret;
	        }
	        return origin;
	}
	
	function removeInjection(object, injection, name)
	{
	        if (injection[name] === undefined)
	                delete object[name];
	        else
	                object[name] = injection[name];
	}
	
To use them :

	//We store the injection, so we have to option to disable it later
	inections=[];
	injections['injectionOfLookupIndex']=injectToFunction(Workspace.prototype, '_lookupIndex',  function(){return 1;});
	// To de-inject the code:
	removeInjection(Workspace.prototype, injections,  'injectionOfLookupIndex');
	
With this, we can add some code to the function without replacing the whole function. Our code is written before the return statement of the original function and after all code of the original function
